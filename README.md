# Retail__Returns__Dashboard
his project contains an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of retail returns performance, offering insights into return rates, year-over-year changes, and employee contribution to return differences.

üéØ Key Metrics & Goals
The primary goal of this dashboard is to monitor and analyze the efficiency of the retail operation concerning product returns. Key metrics are highlighted at the top for immediate performance assessment:

Return Rate %: Current overall percentage of returns (e.g., 0.09).

YoY % Change: Year-over-Year change in the Return Rate (e.g., 0.60).

YoY Avg. Return Value: The average monetary value of returns compared to the previous year (e.g., 206.67).

YoY Avg. Value % Change: The percentage change in the average return value (e.g., -0.06).

Total Returns: The total count of returns recorded (e.g., 594).

üí° Dashboard Components & Visualizations
The dashboard is structured into several key sections to address different aspects of the returns data:

1. Employee Performance Analysis
This section focuses on individual contribution to the overall return difference:

% contribution by employee with YoY difference: A Donut Chart shows the percentage breakdown of the year-over-year difference in returns contributed by key personnel (Anna, Maigee, Kelly Williams, Casandra Brandow, etc.). This helps pinpoint which employees or regions are driving the change in return volume.

Top 5 employees by returns with YoY comparison: A Bar Chart visually compares Total Returns and Total Returns Last Year for the top 5 employees, allowing for quick identification of who has seen the largest increase or decrease in returns volume.

2. Temporal Trends
Monthly return trends with YoY overlay: A Time-Series Chart (likely a column or line chart) displays the total monthly returns over a period (e.g., from Jul 2014 onwards) with a year-over-year overlay. This helps identify seasonality and track long-term trends in returns.

3. Data Context & Filtering
The left-hand side provides the core context for the analysis, which can be used for filtering:

Personnel List: A slicer or list showing individual employees (Person).

Geographic Regions: A slicer or list showing operational regions (Region).

Date Slicer: A date-range slicer allowing users to filter the view by specific transaction dates (Date).

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Data Visualization: Microsoft Power BI Desktop

Language (Implicit): DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating custom measures and calculated columns within Power BI.

Data Source (Assumed): A retail transaction/returns database (e.g., SQL Server, CSV, Excel files, etc.).
